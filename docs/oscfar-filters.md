### Functions

<a name="oscfar-filters-remove_baseline_peaks"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.remove_baseline_peaks

```python
def remove_baseline_peaks(data, detection_indices, noise_estimates, secondary_threshold_factor = 2.0):
```

Removes detected peaks that are too close to the baseline using a secondary amplitude threshold\.

-   **detection_indices** (`np.ndarray`): Indices of peaks detected by OS-CFAR\.
-   **noise_estimates** (`np.ndarray`): Array of noise estimates corresponding to each detection\.
-   **secondary_threshold_factor** (`float`): Factor multiplied by the noise estimate
    to set the secondary threshold\.

    <a name="oscfar-filters-median_filter"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.median_filter

```python
def median_filter(data, kernel_size):
```

Applies a median filter to the 1D data\.

**Parameters:**

-   **data** (`np.ndarray`): 1D array of input data\.
-   **kernel_size** (`int`): The size of the median filter kernel\. Must be a
    positive integer\. If even, it will be incremented
    by 1 to ensure an odd size\.

**Returns:**

-   `np.ndarray`: The median-filtered data array, same shape as input\.

**Raises:**

-   **ValueError**: If input data is not a 1D numpy array, or if kernel_size
    is not a positive integer\.
    <a name="oscfar-filters-lowpass_filter"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.lowpass_filter

```python
def lowpass_filter(data, cutoff_freq, sampling_rate, order = 5):
```

Applies a low-pass Butterworth filter to the 1D data\.

This uses a zero-phase filter \('filtfilt'\) to avoid introducing phase shifts in the filtered signal\.

**Parameters:**

-   **data** (`np.ndarray`): 1D array of input data \(e\.g\., time series\)\.
-   **cutoff_freq** (`float`): The desired cutoff frequency in Hz\. Frequencies

    This is crucial for digital filter design\.
-   **order** (`int`): The order of the Butterworth filter\. Higher
    orders provide a steeper rolloff but can be
    less stable\. Defaults to 5\.

**Returns:**

-   `np.ndarray`: The low-pass filtered data array, same shape as input\.

**Raises:**

-   **ValueError**: If input data is not a 1D numpy array, or if
    cutoff_freq or sampling_rate are invalid\.

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.highpass_filter

```python
def highpass_filter(data, cutoff_freq, sampling_rate, order = 5):

phase shifts in the filtered signal\.

**Parameters:**

-   **data** (`np.ndarray`): 1D array of input data \(e\.g\., time series\)\.
-   **cutoff_freq** (`float`): The desired cutoff frequency in Hz\. Frequencies

    orders provide a steeper rolloff but can be
    less stable\. Defaults to 5\.

**Returns:**

-   `np.ndarray`: The high-pass filtered data array, same shape as input\.

**Raises:**

-   **ValueError**: If input data is not a 1D numpy array, or if
    cutoff_freq or sampling_rate are invalid\.
    <a name="oscfar-filters-group_close_peaks"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.group_close_peaks

```python
def group_close_peaks(peak_indices, min_distance):
```

Groups peak indices that are close to each other\.

Iterates through sorted peak indices and groups any peaks that are
separated by less than or equal to 'min_distance' samples\.

**Parameters:**

-   **peak_indices** (`list or np.ndarray`): A list or array of peak indices,
    assumed to be sorted or will be sorted\.
-   **min_distance** (`int`): The maximum distance \(in samples\) between two
    consecutive peaks for them to be considered
    part of the same group\.

**Returns:**

-   `list[list[int]]`: A list where each element is a list representing a
    group of close peak indices\. Returns an empty list
    if no peaks are provided\.
    <a name="oscfar-filters-find_representative_peaks"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.find_representative_peaks

```python
def find_representative_peaks(data, peak_indices, min_distance):
```

Groups close peaks and returns the index of the maximum peak from each group\.

First, groups peaks that are within 'min_distance' of each other using
group_close_peaks\. Then, for each group, identifies the index
corresponding to the highest value in the 'data' array\.

**Parameters:**

-   **data** (`np.ndarray`): The 1D data array \(e\.g\., time series\) where
    peak values are found\. Used to determine the max peak\.
-   **peak_indices** (`list or np.ndarray`): A list or array of peak indices
    to be grouped and processed\.
-   **min_distance** (`int`): The maximum distance \(in samples\) between two
    consecutive peaks for them to be considered
    part of the same group\.

**Returns:**

-   `list[int]`: A list containing the index of the maximum peak from
    each identified group\. Returns an empty list if no
    peaks are provided\.
    <a name="oscfar-filters-verify_peaks_snr"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.verify_peaks_snr

```python
def verify_peaks_snr(data, peak_indices, noise_window_factor = 3, min_snr = 3.0):
```

Verifies peaks based on their local Signal-to-Noise Ratio \(SNR\)\.

Calculates SNR for each peak relative to the noise estimated in
adjacent windows\.

**Parameters:**

-   **data** (`np.ndarray`): The 1D data array \(e\.g\., time series\) where
    peaks were detected\.
-   **peak_indices** (`list or np.ndarray`): Indices of the detected peaks\.
-   **noise_window_factor** (`int`): Determines the size and offset
    of the noise estimation windows
    relative to a conceptual 'peak width'\.
    A simple proxy for peak width \(e\.g\., 5 samples\)
    is used internally\. The noise windows will
    be roughly this size and offset by
    this amount from the peak center\.
    Defaults to 3\.
-   **min_snr** (`float`): The minimum acceptable local SNR for a
    peak to be considered verified\. Defaults to 3\.0\.

**Returns:**

-   `list`: A list of indices corresponding to the verified peaks\.

**Raises:**

-   **ValueError**: If input data is not a 1D numpy array\.
    <a name="oscfar-filters-enforce_min_distance"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.enforce_min_distance

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.filter_peaks_by_extent_1d

```python
def filter_peaks_by_extent_1d(peak_indices, min_extent, max_extent):

    where peaks were detected by CFAR\.
    Assumed to be along a single dimension\.
-   **max_extent** (`int`): The maximum allowed number of consecutive indices
    for a valid peak group\. Groups larger than this
    are considered extended clutter/scattering and removed\.

**Returns:**

-   `list`: A list of filtered peak indices, keeping only those belonging
    to groups with extent \<= max_extent\.
    <a name="oscfar-filters-moving_average_filter"></a>

### ðŸ…µ oscfar\.filters\.moving_average_filter

```python
def moving_average_filter(data, window_size):
```

Applies a simple moving average filter to the 1D data\.

Each point in the output is the average of the 'window_size' neighboring
points in the input data \(including the point itself\)\. Uses 'same' mode
for convolution, meaning the output array has the same size as the input,
but edge effects might be present where the window doesn't fully overlap\.

**Parameters:**

-   **data** (`np.ndarray`): 1D array of input data\.
-   **window_size** (`int`): The number of points to include in the averaging
    window\. Should be an odd number for a centered average,
    but works with even numbers too\. Must be positive\.

**Returns:**

-   `np.ndarray`: The smoothed data array, same shape as input\.

**Raises:**

-   **ValueError**: If input data is not a 1D numpy array or if window_size
    is not a positive integer\.
